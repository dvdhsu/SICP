## Exercise 2.24

	(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))

The above expression should return a list that has two elements: 1 and another list. The other list should be a list with two elements as well: 2 and another list. This last list has 2 elements: 3 and 4. 

Running this through the Scheme interpreter, the above seems correct:

	(length (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4))))
	
	Value: 2

	length (list 2 (list 3 4)))

	Value: 2
